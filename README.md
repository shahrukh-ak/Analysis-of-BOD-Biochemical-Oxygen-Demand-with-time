# Analysis-of-BOD-Biochemical-Oxygen-Demand-with-time
An article in the Journal of the Environmental Engineering Division [Least Squares
Estimates of BOD Parameters (1980, Vol. 106, pp. 1197â€“1202)] took a sample from the
Holston River below Kingport, Tennessee, during August 1977. The biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD) test is conducted over a period of time in days. The resulting data follow: <br>

## Objectives: <br>

- Assuming that a linear regression model is appropriate, fit the regression model relating
BOD (y) to the time (x).<br>
- What is the estimated value of alpha^2?<br>
- What is the estimate of expected BOD level when the time is 15 days? Provide a 90%
confidence interval and prediction interval?<br>
- What change in mean BOD is expected when the time changes by three days?
